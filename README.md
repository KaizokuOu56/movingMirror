Using machine learning to compute Hawking radiation spectra for a given black hole path in a Penrose diagram

neur_network_merged is the code for a single neural network that learns both the real and imaginary factors of the fourier transform  
neur_network_separate is the code for two networks that learn the real and imaginary factors independently, producing far more accuracy
